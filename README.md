# Pigeon

### What's Pigeon?

üê¶ Pigeon is a lightweight tool for generating a REST API using mongoose, express, and express-validator.

### Assumptions

It's important to define what this tool does and does not facilitate.

I assume that developers who use pigeon are comfortable writing mongoose schemas, if their project calls for it.

I also assume that they will understand how to extend the tooling by writing their own custom controllers and validation if necessary.

### How does it work?

Nearly everything you need to understand resides in `middleware/index.js`.

I'll write a quick rundown soon.
